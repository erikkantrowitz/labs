Okay without changing anything, I want you to look through my code, and give it a grade. I want you to act as my tutor or a senior engineer trying to help me get better. I want you to tell me what worked, what I missed, what I could do better, what works but isn't pythonic, etc. I want you to explain to me all of this and teach me how to get better. If I didn't use a certain method teach me about it don't just tell me you could have done it this way.
