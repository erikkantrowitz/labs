# Python Beginner Challenge 3: Function Collection
#
# Objective: Write and test three different functions that perform common tasks.
# Then, in the main code, call these functions with sample inputs and print the results.
#
# Requirements:
# - Function 1: is_even(num) - takes an integer, returns True if even, False otherwise.
# - Function 2: factorial(n) - takes a non-negative integer, returns its factorial (n!).
# - Function 3: reverse_string(s) - takes a string, returns the reversed string.
# - In the main code: Call each function with at least one test case and print the results.
# - Use proper function definitions with def, parameters, and return statements.
# - Handle edge cases (e.g., factorial(0) = 1, empty string).
#
# Hints:
# - is_even: return num % 2 == 0
# - factorial: Use a loop to multiply from 1 to n, or recursion if comfortable.
# - reverse_string: return s[::-1] or use a loop to build reversed string.
# - Main code: print("is_even(4):", is_even(4))
#
# This challenge covers: Functions, Conditionals, Loops, Basic Operations.
