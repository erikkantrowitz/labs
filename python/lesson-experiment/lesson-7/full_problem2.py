# Student Grade Analyzer
#
# Objective:
# Create a program to analyze student grades stored in a structured way using lists and tuples.
#
# Requirements:
# - Store students as a list of tuples: (name, [grades])
# - Implement functions: add_student(name), add_grade(name, grade), get_average(name), get_class_average()
# - Use loops to calculate averages
# - Use conditionals to validate inputs
#
# Hints:
# - Nested structures: list of tuples containing lists
# - Functions should handle cases where student doesn't exist
#
# Bonus:
# - Find top performers
# - Generate grade distribution
