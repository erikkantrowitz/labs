# Tuple as Key Drill
#
# Objective:
# Use tuples as dictionary keys.
#
# Requirements:
# - Create a dict with tuple keys (x,y) and values as some calculation
#
# Scaffolding:
def create_coord_dict(coords):
    coord_dict = {}
    for coord in coords:
        # coord is tuple (x,y)
        # value = x + y or something
        pass
    return coord_dict
#
# Hints:
# - Tuples are hashable, lists are not
#
# Bonus:
# - Use nested tuples
