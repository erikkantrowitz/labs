# Tuple Unpacking Drill
#
# Objective:
# Learn to unpack tuples in loops.
#
# Requirements:
# - Given a list of tuples (x, y), calculate the distance for each and return list of distances
#
# Scaffolding:
def calculate_distances(points):
    distances = []
    for point in points:
        # Unpack here
        pass
    return distances
#
# Hints:
# - Use for x, y in points:
#
# Bonus:
# - Use list comprehension

points = [(1,2), (6,5), (4,5), (0,0)]
